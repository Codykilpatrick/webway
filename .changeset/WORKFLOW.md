# Changeset-Driven Release Workflow

This project uses **changesets** as the primary method for version control and releases. Every PR that includes user-facing changes **must** include at least one changeset.

## ðŸ”„ Development Workflow

### 1. Making Changes
When you make changes that should be released:

```bash
# Make your code changes
git checkout -b feature/my-awesome-feature

# After making changes, create a changeset
yarn changeset

# Follow the prompts:
# - Select packages that changed
# - Choose version bump type (patch/minor/major)  
# - Write a summary of changes
# - Optionally add detailed description
```

### 2. Changeset Selection Guide

**Major (Breaking Changes):**
- Removing or renaming public APIs
- Changing function signatures
- Removing support for versions/platforms
- Any change that requires users to update their code

**Minor (New Features):**
- Adding new public APIs
- Adding new optional parameters
- New functionality that doesn't break existing code
- Performance improvements

**Patch (Bug Fixes):**
- Bug fixes
- Documentation updates
- Internal refactoring without API changes
- Dependency updates
- Any change that impacts code not infrastrcture (package.json scripts, Github actions, etc...) should have at least a patch changeset.

### 3. Changeset File Example

```markdown
---
"@webway/data-parser": minor
---

Add support for APB22 file format parsing

This adds a new parser for the APB22 format with the following features:
- Binary parser for APB22 format
- Arrow and Protobuf output support  
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Updated documentation

Breaking changes: None
Migration: No action required
```

### 4. Creating Pull Requests

- **Include changeset files** in your PR
- PR validation will **fail** if no changeset is included
- Use `skip-changeset` label only for:
  - Documentation-only changes
  - CI/CD updates
  - Internal tooling
  - Test updates

### 5. Release Process

**Automated Release Flow:**

1. **Developer** creates PR with changeset â†’ PR validation passes
2. **Maintainer** merges PR â†’ Changesets accumulate on main
3. **Weekly/As needed**: Run `yarn release:prepare` â†’ Creates release PR
4. **Maintainer** reviews release PR â†’ Merges when ready
5. **Automation** creates GitHub release and publishes packages

## ðŸš€ Release Commands

```bash
# Create a changeset (always do this for changes)
yarn changeset

# Check current changeset status
yarn changeset:status

# Check if PR needs changesets (CI validation)
yarn changeset:check

# Consume changesets and create release PR (maintainers)
yarn release:prepare

# Create GitHub release after release PR is merged (automation)
yarn release:publish

# Manual version bump (alternative to release:prepare)
yarn version
```
